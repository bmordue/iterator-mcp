Absolutely! Here's the MCP server implementation in TypeScript:And here's the accompanying `package.json` file you'll need:## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Build the TypeScript:**
```bash
npm run build
```

3. **Configure in your MCP client** (like Claude Desktop). Add to your config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dataset-processor": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/dataset-processor-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Example

Once connected to an MCP-compatible chat interface, you can:

1. **Load a dataset:**
   - "Load my dataset from `/path/to/dataset.jsonl`"

2. **Process records iteratively:**
   - "Get the next record for processing"
   - *[AI processes the record and responds with analysis]*
   - "Save this result: [your analysis]"

3. **Track progress:**
   - "What's my processing status?"

4. **Export results:**
   - "Export all results to `/path/to/results.json`"

## Key Advantages of This Approach:

1. **No API Keys Required**: The MCP server acts as middleware, and you interact through your regular chat interface
2. **Stateful Processing**: The server maintains state between requests, tracking your progress
3. **Flexible Navigation**: You can jump to specific records, reset, or continue where you left off
4. **Error Recovery**: If something goes wrong, your progress is maintained
5. **Export Capabilities**: Save your processing results at any time

This approach gives you the power of programmatic dataset iteration while keeping the conversational interface you prefer, and without needing to manage API keys or write complex scripts.
